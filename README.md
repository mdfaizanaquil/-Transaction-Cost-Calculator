# Transaction Cost Calculator

A simple web utility to calculate the estimated cost of an Ethereum transaction in both ETH and USD.

## Features
- Fetches the current ETH/USD price from the CoinGecko API.
- Calculates transaction cost based on user-provided gas price and gas limit.

## How to Use
1.  **Install Dependencies:** This project uses `axios` to fetch the price. For local development, you'll need to serve it with a simple server, but for GitHub Pages it will work as is.
2.  **Run:** Open `index.html` in your browser.
